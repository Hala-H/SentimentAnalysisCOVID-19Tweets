# SentimentAnalysisCOVID-19Tweets
Sentiment analysis of COVID-19 tweets in Saudi Arabia.

## Abstract
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease that penetrated Saudi Arabia in March 2020. It has caused a rise of hate speech across social media, including Twitter. The objective of the study is to analyze the trend of hate speech during the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The method used in this study is based on machine learning classification techniques. Preliminary results show that so far, after using hydrating methods on tweet IDs, about 900 thousand out of the 1.3 million English tweets were successfully collected. The study concluded that in the future, this collected data will be preprocessed, then trained by applying several different classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),  Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB).

## Problem Statement
At the beginning of March 2020, the COVID-19 virus had penetrated the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This news became a popular topic among Twitter users within the region. Since then, multiple voices have been raised across social media using the COVID-19 pandemic as a vehicle for spreading hate speech. According to research, around the world, racism and discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities have increased during the pandemic (Lee & Li, 2020). The ethnic groups are mainly Chinese or any Asian race, so a large part of the hatred was xenophobic. Another type of hatred was directed towards governments that apply prevention methods to reduce the spread of the virus by imposing lockdowns, travel bans, and enforcing vaccinations. This spread of hate makes it necessary to identify hate speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic by Twitter users in Saudi Arabia to discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing hate speech. And to mobilize and stand up against this hate speech, especially those subjected towards a specific group.  The most effective way to detect and narrow the main reasons behind this speech is to utilize current technology, notably sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques.
